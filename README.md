Code examples applying SOLID principles

- S – Single Responsibility Principle
- O – Open/Closed Principle
- L – Liskov Substitution Principle
- I – Interface Segregation Principle
- D – Dependency Inversion Principle

#### What is the Single Responsibility Principle?
A class should have only one reason to change. Each class or module should focus on a single task or responsibility.

#### What is the Open/Closed Principle?
Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

#### What is the Liskov Substitution Principle?
Subclasses should be able to replace their parent classes without breaking the code.

#### What is the Interface Segregation Principle?
Clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on interfaces they don’t use.

#### What is the Dependency Inversion Principle?
High-level modules shouldn’t depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
